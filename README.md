### 1. Project Context & Vision
**Project Name:** Atlas Insurance Analytics Platform
**Vision:** Transform insurance operation through data-driven insights and automation 
**Core Problem Statement**: Siloed data across policy, claims, customer systems leading to inefficient pricing, slow claims, and missed opportunities

#### Background 
The Atlas Insurance Company data engineering and analysis project is a strategic initiative to create a single source of truth for all insurance data for anlysis and modelling. This centralized, modern data platform will empower the organization with accurate, timely, and accessible data for regulatory reporting, advanced customer analytics, risk management, and operational intelligence. By moving away from seperate data sources and fragemented reports, we aim to drive efficiency, enhance decision-making, and maintain a competitive edge in the market. 

#### Business Objective 
**Vision:**
To enable a data-driven culture at Atlas Insurance by providing a secure, scalable, and trusted data platform that turns raw data into a strategic asset.

**Key Business Objectives:**
1. **Quantify Current State:** Determine actual loss ratios and combined ratios across all products
2. **Identify Problem Areas:** Pinpoint specific products, segments, or regions with unsustainable loss experience
3. **Establish Benchmarks:** Compare performance against available industry standards.
4. **Create Baseline Models:** Develop initial pricing and reserving models based on historical data
5. **Building Monitoring Foundation:** Implement systems to track ongoing performance.

**Note:** Specific numerical targets will be established after initial analysis reveals current performance levels. The project will first answer "Where are we?" before determining "Where should we go?"
